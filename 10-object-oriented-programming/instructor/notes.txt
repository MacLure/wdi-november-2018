- Advantages of OOP

1. Encapsulation
  - Group of related ideas together in a unit, give it a name
  - Can reason about it much easier
  - Allows to "classify" concepts

2. Information Hiding
  - State is private by default
  - The only way to access state is through behaviour

3. Abstraction
  - The internals of an object is irrelevant
  - All I need to care about are what it can do,
    and how to ask it to do these things

- Class vs Instance

  - Class: Blueprint for specific instances (idea)
  - Instance: Specific occurence of a thing


Object    | State                  | Behaviour
----------+------------------------+------------------------
Instance  | Instance Variables (@) | Instance Methods (def)
?????     | ?????                  | ?????
