# Intro

'Debugging' is a term popularly attributed to Grace Hopper, after finding a moth in a computer system.

<small>
  (the term 'bug' already existed, but this time it was literally a bug. Now 'bug' is the term software developers use.)

# Debugging and Software Development

Debugging is a part of the software development cycle.

Generally, programming is continual cycle of:

code -> debug -> code -> debug -> ...

--

<br>

Bugs do not mean failure!

--

<br>

You'll probably spend more time debugging than writing your initial code.

--

<br>

It's a skill you can develop and it's worth investing time into it.

# Types of Bugs

## Syntax errors

## Runtime errors

## Logical errors
---


# Syntax errors

  - the easiest to fix
  - error messages are usually clear as to what the problem is and how to fix it
  - often our code won't even begin executing due to these errors
---


# Runtime errors

  - some of our code runs, but then it crashes when it runs into this error
  - a little more difficult to find and fix
---


# Logical errors

  - the hardest to fix
  - often we have to do some introspection into our code to understand what's going on
  - sometimes you may not even notice these errors until well after you've written the code (and are less familiar with the code)
---


# Common Ruby Errors

- undefined local variable or method
- undefined method for nilclass
- undefined method for something
- unexpected end of input, expecting keyword_end
- unexpected keyword end
- no implicit conversion
- wrong number of arguments

# Avoiding Bugs
---


What are some techniques we can use to avoid bugs from happening?
---


Read and understand the code you write.
---


Write short bits of code at a time. Then run and test it to ensure the code works as expected.
---


Try bits of code in IRB first.
---


Close code blocks as soon as you open them.

Examples:

- when you write `if`, immediately write `end`
- when you write `do`, immediately write `end`
- when you write `def`, immediately write `end`
- when you write `{`, immediately write `}`
- when you write `'` or `"`, immediately write `'` or `"`

Often your editor will do this automatically for you.
---


Pair programming.

- one person *navigates*: directs the driver where to go and thinks about the larger problem
- one person *drives*: types on the keyboard and thinks more specifically about the exact code being written

--

- the driver should let the navigator control the overall process or they risk the navigator disengaging from the process
- swap out the driver and navigator at regular intervals
---


Organize your code: adhere to the single responsibility principal.

- each class is responsible for one area

- each method does only one thing
---


Example of a method not adhering to the Single Responsibility Principal:

```ruby
def math(function)
  if function == 'add'
    puts 'adding one to count'
    @count += 1
  elsif function == 'subtract'
    puts 'subtracting one from count'
    @count -= 1
  end
end

puts 'Setting count to 0'
@count = 0

math('add')
math('add')
math('subtract')

puts "Final Count:"
puts @count
```
---


```ruby
def add_one
  puts 'adding one to count'
  @count += 1
end

def subtract_one
  puts 'subtracting one from count'
  @count -= 1
end

puts 'Setting count to 0'
@count = 0

add_one
add_one
subtract_one

puts "Final Count:"
puts @count
```
---


Keep your code DRY (do not repeat yourself).

*Why does this help?*
---


Properly indent your code.

*Why does this help?*
---


Use meaningful names (for variables, methods and classes)

*Why does this help?*
---


## Be consistent.

- When calling a method with an argument, use the same variable name in both the caller and the receiver.
---


### Not consistent:

```ruby
def add(amount)
  puts "adding #{amount} to count"
  @count += amount
end

def subtract(number)
  puts "subtracting #{number} from count"
  @count -= number
end

puts 'Setting count to 0'
@count = 0

num = 5

add(3)
add(num)
subtract(2)

puts "Final Count:"
puts @count
```
---


### Consistent:

```ruby
def add(amount)
  puts "adding #{amount} to count"
  @count += amount
end

def subtract(amount)
  puts "subtracting #{amount} from count"
  @count -= amount
end

puts 'Setting count to 0'
@count = 0

amount = 5

add(3)
add(amount)
subtract(2)

puts "Final Count:"
puts @count
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Use full names for variables

### Bad:

```ruby
anims = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```

### Good:

```ruby
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Properly pluralize variables that represent a collection<br>(e.g. `Array` or `Hash`)

### Bad:

```ruby
animal = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```

### Good:

```ruby
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Name your classes consistently

### Bad:

```ruby
class Dog
  SOUND = 'woof'
end

class Cat
  SOUND = 'meow'
end

class Animal
  SOUND = 'chirp'
end
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Name your classes consistently

### Good:

```ruby
class Dog
  SOUND = 'woof'
end

class Cat
  SOUND = 'meow'
end

class Bird
  SOUND = 'chirp'
end
```
---


## Use best practices.

e.g. avoid global variables

*Why are global variables bad?*
---


## Write automated tests for your code

*How do tests help?*

# Debugging Techniques

*What are some debugging techniques?*
---


# Read the error message

- read it slowly and try to comprehend it completely
- looking for the line number where the error is located
- follow the stack trace

*How does a stack trace work?*
---


# Simplify your code

- break long methods into shorter methods that are easier to reason about
---


# Simplify your code

*For complex bugs:*

Try isolating what you're working on into a separate program and get that working first before integrating it into your larger project.

--

### For example:

If you're having trouble using `each` on a hash:

- try writing a little program with just a single hash using `each`
- get that working
- ensure you understand how it works
- carry that code over to your larger, real program
---


# Simplify your code

*For complex bugs:*


### Rails App Twilio Example:

Twilio is a service that let's you send text messages to people.

Let's say you're trying to integrate this service into your app.

- first, write a little Ruby program in a single file that sends a text message using Twilio
- when that's working, move the code into your main app's codebase
---


# Searching the web:

## Google

When googling, use your error message, but remove line numbers and anything specific to your program.

For example, if you had this error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
counter.rb:28:in `<main>': undefined method `subtact_one' for #<Counter:0x00007fe2db036748 @count=2> (NoMethodError)
Did you mean?  subtract_one
```

Then you'd google:

```
undefined method for NoMethodError
```

*What was removed before googling?*
---


# Searching the web:


## Stackoverflow:

generally it's good to skip the question and go straight to the answers

--

look at the votes for the first two answers

--

focus on the answer that the most votes

- Usually the first answer is useful, but occasionally the second answer will be much better than the first

--

*Example:*

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44715/why-do-ruby-setters-need-self-qualification-within-the-class
---


# Rubber duck debugging

- Explain the problem to someone else -- this process often results in you solving your own problem

or

- You can explain it to an imaginary (or real) rubber duck by your computer
---


# Ask for help

Don't spend longer than ten minutes on a problem.

Ask an instructor or another student for help.

The same advice applies for when you get a job: your employer will want you to be productive. They won't want you to spin your wheels for too long.
---


# Read the docs

*Tip:* you can access Ruby documentation from your command line using `ri`:

```shell
❯ ri Array
❯ ri Array.empty?
```
---


# Read the docs

### Understand how the documentation is structured:

- what methods are available on what class

- how method signatures work

- the return value of methods

try:

```shell
❯ ri String
❯ ri String.delete_suffix
```

- What methods does String support?
- What's the method signature for String.delete_suffix?
- What's the return value for String.delete_suffix?

# Gems
---


What are gems?

--

Finding gems and info about them:

https://rubygems.org/
---


Install a gem:

```shell
❯ gem install interesting_methods
```

--

Try it out:

```ruby
require 'interesting_methods'

animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']

puts animals.im
```
---


See the code of a gem on the web:

https://github.com/seanlerner/interesting_methods

--

<hr>

Open gem code in your editor:

```shell
❯ gem open interesting_methods
```

--

<hr>

Return modified gem code to its original state:

```shell
❯ gem pristine interesting_methods
```

# Print things to the screen

## Comes with Ruby core/standard library:

- `puts`

--

- `p` (like puts, but calls `inspect` on the object)

--

- `pp` (pretty print)

--

## Gems:

- `ap` (awesome print)

  - `raw: true`

--

- `tp` (table print)
---


# Using a Debugger

Use a debugger to set breakpoints and inspect your code.

## pry

```ruby
require 'pry'

# ...

binding.pry
```

--

demo pry with `working-example.rb`

--

try the `book-store-pry-exercise.rb` in the examples folder
---


# Most useful pry commands


- whereami
- ls
- backtrace
- show-method
- show-doc
- exit
- exit!
- help
---


# Using a Debugger

pry-byebug

- next
- continue
---


# Using a Debugger

binding.irb

- a simple alternative that comes with Ruby
---


# Rescuing

```ruby
require 'pry'

def my_method
  greeting = 'hello'
  person   = 'matz'

  1 / 0 # something bad!

rescue
  binding.pry
end


my_method
```
