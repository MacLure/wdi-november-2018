# JavaScript Fundamentals

In this lesson, we'll be covering the origins of JavaScript, as well as some the basic language constructs.

Bounce between explanation (on slides) and coding some examples in skeleton.js .

## Agenda - 5 minutes
After this lesson, you will know:

  * Data types and built-in functions
  * Variable assignment
  * Flow control
  * Loops
  * Defining our own functions

Slides here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15qjYctB823Jd3Bp7b89SiZkWXWfCn6g7xFGl9RjRfbM/edit

## What is JavaScript/where does it run? - 5 minutes

  * Show the MDN description of JS
  * Talk about the browser and why JS is such a big deal.
  * Mention node.js.
  * JavaScript is not Java! (not allowed to abbreviate JS to 'Java')

## Ruby vs JavaScript - 5 minutes

  * Show examples.js side-by-side with examples.rb (pick a good spot to show, eg. simple for loop section)
    * What looks different? (eg. `var` used for variables)
    * What looks the same? (much more open)
  * JavaScript is more syntax-heavy (eg. curly braces)


#### --- From this point on, bounce between slides and working through skeleton.js. examples.js is there as a reference if you need it.

## Data types - 15 minutes

  * different data types
  * use of `var`
  * use semi-colons! Always!

## Control Flow - 15 minutes

  * `if` statement, `switch`, `for` loop, `while` loop
  * Equality in JavaScript
    * use triple equals! (5 minutes - make this super clear)


#### --- 5-10 minute break here ---

## JavaScript Arrays - 15 minutes

  * Exactly like arrays in Ruby!
  * Use for-loop for iteration in the basic case
  * There are other ways to iterate, but we need functions to do it!
    * Will look at this tomorrow

## JavaScript Objects - 15 minutes

  * like hashes in Ruby!
  * JSON (briefly) - just a notation!
  * Can do obj.attrName instead of obj['attrName'] - Ruby can't do this!

## Intro to Functions - 5 minutes

  * Call them functions instead of methods in JavaScript
  * Function declaration
  * Function expression
  * Anonymous functions

## Wrap-up - 5 minutes

  * JavaScript gotchas
  * Why is JavaScript a big deal?
